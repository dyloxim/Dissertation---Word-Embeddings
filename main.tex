In this report we attempt to provide a complete introduction to the core theories of word embeddings (numerical vector representations of words as they appear in text) sufficient to enable further reading of more advanced topics. This introduction covers briefly the linguistic context, theoretical development, most impactful implementations, and practical considerations of application of word embedding methods. In the first section we discuss the nature of the words, in the second we describe the cross disciplinary events which lead to development the key mathematical techniques for producing embeddings and explain their operation, and finally we discuss practical considerations of these algorithm's applications. As the primary relevance of these methods within research is their practical application we take a broader contextual approach opposed to a purely mathematical one and focus on the developments and methods most influential in the sphere of application. We assume familiarity with core mathematics at an undergraduate level as prerequisite for our descriptions of the selected implementation methods but otherwise assume no prior knowledge of the subject area.
