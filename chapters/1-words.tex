\chapter{Words}
To make use of either word embedding algorithms and their outputs for some practical means an understanding of related linguistic concepts is not necessarily needed, however, we consider a grounding in these terms illuminating context for a more reasoned application and understanding of these methods. In particular, understanding these concepts is key to understanding some of the shortcomings of the models discussed in this report and the modifications made by later models to address those.
